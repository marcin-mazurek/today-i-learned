# Data Warehouses

Data Warehouse hosts consolidated data from multiple locations (databases), usually imported through incremental ETL pipelines. It is used for business intelligence. Its engine is specifically optimized for data analytics (called OLAP = online analytical processing - readonly operations that do not require transactions).

### Structured vs unstructured data

**Structured data** has consistent schema, cleaned data and can be fit into a queryable table in a database.
**Unstructured data** has no or inconsistent schema or structure.

### Data lake

Data lake is a centralized place for structured and unstructured data storage of different type, such as images, text, files, videos.
