## D2

D2 stands for _Declarative Diagramming_ and is a simple scripting language for defining architecture diagrams as code, thereby making them code reviewable and easy to maintain. It is also very helpful for remote system design interviews.

Example:

Check [crypto-portfolio-tracker-data-flow.d2](https://github.com/marcin-mazurek/today-i-learned/blob/master/architecture/crypto-portfolio-tracker-data-flow.d2) to see the underlying code.

The [D2 Online Playground](https://play.d2lang.com/) can be used for working on those diagrams in an online environment.
