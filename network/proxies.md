# Proxies

- Forward proxy - also known just as "proxy", is a proxy that handles traffic from a client to server. It can be used to anonymise the client, filter content, may be combined with a cache to lower bandwidth usage.
- Reverse proxy - accepts a request from a client, forwards it to a server that can fulfill it, and returns the serverâ€™s response to the client. Can be used to handle application delivery, manage traffic, load balancing, SSL decryption, compression, DoS protection, etc. Examples: [Nginx](https://www.nginx.com/)
- Caching proxy - a type of reverse proxy, that specializes in caching server responses. Examples: [Varnish](https://varnish-cache.org/), [Squid](http://www.squid-cache.org/)
