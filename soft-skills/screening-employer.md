2. Do they have a technical blog? How often the posts are published there?
3. Do they have a company GitHub profile? How many projects are there? Are they being updated?
4. What are the reviews on Glassdoor and similar websites?
5. Who is working there? Can you find guys with interesting LinkedIn or GitHub profiles? Do they speak on conferences?

## Questions to ask during an interview

2. Are there opportunities to work on/contribute to open source projects?
3. What's the developers workload? (%)
4. Are working hours flexible?
5. Is there a dedicated, offically approved time for trainings and learning?
6. Do you offer English lessons? One to one or in groups?
