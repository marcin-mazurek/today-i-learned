# Debugging teams - book summary

## Key thoughts

* Embrace HRT - humility, respect, trust
* Document your failures - write up "postmortems" - summary, timeline of the event, the primary cause of the event, impact and damage assesment, a set of actions to fix the problem, a set of actions to prevent the event from happening again, lessons learned. They do it every time there's production failure at Google
* When working in a geographically challenged team, don't be afraid to regularly get on a plane and visit the rest of the team and build team spirit
* Book 3-4h slots for work in your calendar to get things done
* Prefer asynchronous communication (ticket systems, chats, document) over synchronous (meeting)
* Overcommunicate - don't be afraid to duplicate your messages. Do your best to inform everybody.
* Every effective team *must* have a leader
* Always admit mistakes
* It's ok to fail if you learn from your failures
* Don't lie - tell when you can't tell saomething or admit you don't know it
