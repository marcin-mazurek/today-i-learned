## Work organisation
* Plan your work in time ranges (time for technical tasks, leadership tasks, etc.)
* Even if you're very busy, spend some time (eg. 1-2 hours) on technical tasks, to stay up to date and better understand problems engineers are struggling with
* Build a system for organising your work (eg. GTD methodology)
* Once you make sure the task can be done by somebody else than you - delegate!
* Set up a separate administration tasks board for everything that shouldn't land on the main project board/task system

## Feedback
* Perform regular personal retrospections
* Use the [Disney strategy](https://nlp-now.co.uk/use-disney-strategy) for evaluating ideas
* Have a team feedback/ideas box, where anybody can put an idea anytime (anonymously if needed)
* Provide regular feedback to the team members and the team as a whole. Be specific. Try to say: "I'd like you to..." rather than "don't do..."

## Process and communication
* Define a team Definition of Done and Definition of Ready
* Define a team charter
* Define a procedure for onboarding new team members
* Be transparent. You don't want your team members to learn from gossips in the kitchen
* Overcommunicate. It's better to send some message twice (both Slack and email), than risk missing the message by somebody

## Collaboration
* Build a strong internal network of relationships (other team leaders, project managers in the company)
* Define a clear responsibilities in the team (eg. using the team responsibility matrix)
* Define clear rules for collaboration between the client or business

## Documentation
* Have a decision tracker, where you track important technical and architectural decisions with justification. Example columns: date, decision, problem solved, trade-off, justification, considered alternatives, people involved.

## Conflicts
* Prevent conflicts from happening in the first place by regular retrospectives and one-to-one meetings
* Always be gentle! Avoid personal attacks. Make sure that what you're going to say will not hurt anybody
* If a conclift occurs, try to understand the need ("Why is this important to you?") and intention. Then, try to find a solution, which will be satisfactory for both conflicted sides
