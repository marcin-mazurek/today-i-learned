## First 90 days as a leader
* Day 1-30 - focus on education
* Day 31-60 - create a daily routine
* Day 61-90 - do retrospectives, think whether this role is for you, find your weaknesses and keep improving 

## Main thoughts
* Accept you probably won't have much time for coding. Don't get frustrated by that.
* As a lead developer, you may need to play other roles (eg. BA, Scrum Master). Accept that too!
* Invest in relationships. **This is a key thing to succeed as a leader.** Build a strong internal network of relationships (other team leaders, project managers in the company).
* Understand the whole process that your software is supporting end-to-end, and ideally the whole business. Don't concentrate only on what happens in your team, within your product, try to understand the whole user journey, how various actors interact with the system, etc.
* Be sceptical. Don't trust others by default.

## Work organisation
* Plan your work in time ranges (time for technical tasks, leadership tasks, etc.)
* Even if you're very busy, spend some time (eg. 1-2 hours) on technical tasks, to stay up to date and better understand problems engineers are struggling with
* Build a system for organising your work (eg. GTD methodology)
* Once you make sure the task can be done by somebody else than you - delegate!
* Set up a separate administration tasks board for everything that shouldn't land on the main project board/task system
* Note things you're awaiting from others. People forget about your requests very quickly.

## Meetings hygiene
* Don't be afraid to refuse (gently!) to join a pointless meetings.
* Don't be afraid to walk out from a meeting where you can't bring a value and can't benefit from.
* If you get a meeting invite, first try to understand whether you benefit from or provide any value by joining
* "Another meeting which should've been an email" - try experimenting with different of communication, a lot of meetings can be avoided

## Self-improvement
* If you have a bad habit, don't just try to stop it. Replace it with a good habit.

## Feedback
* Perform regular personal retrospections
* Use the [Disney strategy](https://nlp-now.co.uk/use-disney-strategy) for evaluating ideas
* Have a team feedback/ideas box, where anybody can put an idea anytime (anonymously if needed)
* Provide regular feedback to the team members and the team as a whole. Be specific. Try to say: "I'd like you to..." rather than "don't do..."

## Process and communication
* Define a team Definition of Done and Definition of Ready
* Define a team charter
* Define a procedure for onboarding new team members
* Be transparent. You don't want your team members to learn from gossips in the kitchen
* Overcommunicate. It's better to send some message twice (both Slack and email), than risk missing the message by somebody

## Collaboration
* Define a clear responsibilities in the team (eg. using the team responsibility matrix)
* Define clear rules for collaboration between the client or business

## Motivating
* Money is not a motivator. For professionals money rewards can lead to even worse performance. However, pay enough to take the money topic off the table and let an employee focus on work, not on finding a better paid job.
* What motivates people:
  * autonomy
  * purpose

## Documentation
* Have a decision tracker, where you track important technical and architectural decisions with justification. Example columns: date, decision, problem solved, trade-off, justification, considered alternatives, people involved.

## Conflicts
* Prevent conflicts from happening in the first place by regular retrospectives and one-to-one meetings
* Always be gentle! Avoid personal attacks. Make sure that what you're going to say will not hurt anybody
* If a conclift occurs, try to understand the need ("Why is this important to you?") and intention. Then, try to find a solution, which will be satisfactory for both conflicted sides
