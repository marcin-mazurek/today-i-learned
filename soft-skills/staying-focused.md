# Staying focused
* Have "busy" blocks in calendar - schedule calm hours or even days if needed
* Have regular work schedule (eg. 2h for leadership tasks, 2h for communication)
* Define precise goals
* Decompose tasks into small, well defined ones
* Categorise and prioritise tasks by importance and urgency
* Have a daily activity log and review your activities regularly, try to minimise tasks that don't give much value
