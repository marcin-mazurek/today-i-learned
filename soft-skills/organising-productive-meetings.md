# Organising productive meetings
* Always come prepared to the meeting:
   * Have an agenda
   * Have a list of requirements for meeting participants (eg. familiarise with a particular document, go through some source code)
   * Define an expected output of a meeting
* Go through agenda carefully and make sure you're not getting sidetracked, cut unnecessary discussions
* Focus on actions
