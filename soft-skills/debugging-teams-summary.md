## Key thoughts
* Embrace HRT - humility, respect, trust

## Productivity
* Book 3-4h slots for work in your calendar to get things done

## Career advice
* When taking a new role, try to avoid the impostor syndrome - just fake it till you make it

## Communication
* When working in a geographically challenged team, don't be afraid to regularly get on a plane and visit the rest of the team and build team spirit
* Prefer asynchronous communication (ticket systems, chats, document) over synchronous (meeting)
* Overcommunicate - don't be afraid to duplicate your messages. Do your best to inform everybody.

## Dealing with failures
* Always admit mistakes
* It's ok to fail if you learn from your failures
* Don't lie - tell when you can't tell saomething or admit you don't know it
* Document your failures - write up "postmortems" - summary, timeline of the event, the primary cause of the event, impact and damage assesment, a set of actions to fix the problem, a set of actions to prevent the event from happening again, lessons learned. They do it every time there's production failure at Google

## Team leading
* Every effective team *must* have a leader
* Get your hands dirty - take on a grungy task no one else wants to do
* Give your team air cover - protect them from uncertainty or pressure made by management 
* Let the team know when they're doing well
* Motivate people by giving them autonomy, mastery and purpose - not more money
* Forward positive feedback email from customers to motivate the team to inspire them to thing about ways to make the product even better
