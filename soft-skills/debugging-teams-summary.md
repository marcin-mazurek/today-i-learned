## General thoughts
* Embrace HRT - humility, respect, trust
* It's impossible to stop a bad habit. You need to replace it with a good habit

## Productivity
* Book 3-4h slots for work in your calendar to get things done

## Career advice
* When taking a new role, try to avoid the impostor syndrome - just fake it till you make it
* Pursuit extra responsibility - take risks to show you're capable of bigger things
* Underpromise and overdeliver. Learn to say "no"

## Communication
* When working in a geographically challenged team, don't be afraid to regularly get on a plane and visit the rest of the team and build team spirit
* Prefer asynchronous communication (ticket systems, chats, documents) over synchronous (meeting)
* Overcommunicate - don't be afraid to duplicate your messages. Do your best to inform everybody

## Dealing with failures
* Always admit mistakes
* It's ok to fail if you learn from your failures
* Don't lie - tell when you can't tell saomething or admit you don't know it
* Document your failures - write up "postmortems" - summary, timeline of the event, the primary cause of the event, impact and damage assesment, a set of actions to fix the problem, a set of actions to prevent the event from happening again, lessons learned. They do it every time there's production failure at Google

## Team leading
* Every effective team *must* have a leader
* Get your hands dirty - take on a grungy task no one else wants to do
* Give your team air cover - protect them from uncertainty or pressure made by management 
* Let the team know when they're doing well
* Motivate people by giving them autonomy, mastery and purpose - not more money
* Forward positive feedback email from customers to motivate the team to inspire them to thing about ways to make the product even better

## Poisonous people
* When dealing with hate from users/customers, ignore it, just focus on their feedback and remain civil

## Being managed
* Overcoming micromanagement - send your manager email reports at the same frequency they check in on you
* Traits of a bad manager:
  - fear of failure
  - micromanaging
  - hoarding and hiding information
  - trying to be a proxy for everything
  - stealing credit for someone elses work
  - blaming for failure, either their own or someone else's

## Organizations
* Signs of a bad organization:
  - obsessed with organisational hierarchy
  - treats people as work units or resources
  - does not allow to change projects
  - treats employees like children
  - counts lines of code / meetings attended
* Google have a policy of not preannouncing features for any product to avoid internal death marches to meet an unrealistic deadline
