# Some ideas from [Management 3.0](https://management30.com/)

* Recognise people's effort with kudos box and kudos cards
* Have a "work expo" - stories, work artifacts on a wall rather than mission statements
* Let people pick job titles to avoid title inflation
* Ask people to measure their own performance

## Other interesting motivation techniques
* Pick a "Star of the Sprint"
* Check if meeting was valuable and well led by drawing a line with 0-10 scale and letting people put their mark 
* Measure Happiness Index on retrospective
