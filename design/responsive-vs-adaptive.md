## Responsive - benefits
* RWD doesn’t tie design to a particular device.
* The web is responsive by nature. It doesn't need to respond or adapt to any devices until we start designing it.
## Responsive - drawbacks
* Responsive design often turns into solving a puzzle — how to reorganize elements on larger pages to fit skinnier, longer pages or vice versa. However, ensuring that elements fit within a page is not enough. For a responsive design to be successful, the design must also be usable at all screen resolutions and sizes.
* Performance can also be an issue with responsive design. RWD delivers the same code to all devices, regardless if the piece of code applies to that design or not. Changes to the design occur on the client-side, meaning each device — the phone, tablet or computer — receives the full code for all devices and takes what it needs.
## Adaptive - benefits
* Design can be adjusted to device capabilities.
* Assets are smaller and render faster.
## Adaptive - drawbacks
* Preparing multiple page-layout templates and testing across target, can can be a rather costly and time consuming concept to work with, as well as resource demanding. Making enhancements and modifications to multiple layout templates can be uneconomical, and the structure can be difficult to manage when it comes to multiple views.
* Adaptive design still has to be responsive if we want to provide the best experience.
