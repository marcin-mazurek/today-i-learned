# Font formats to use with `@font-face`
- **WOFF** - Web Open Font Format - supported in IE9+ and all modern browsers
- **WOFF 2** - second version of above, provides better compression, not supported in IE, partially supported in Safari
- **EOF** - Embedded OpenType - Microsoft's format supported in IE, not supported in Edge
- **TTF** - True Type Font - slightly better support than WOFF (namely 2.* Android browsers), doesn't have piracy protection like WOFF
