# JS basics

### Types in JS
#### Primitive
- boolean
- null
- undefined
- number
- string
- symbol

#### Reference
-	object (includes array, function)

### Difference between classic and prototype inheritance
A class is a blueprint. A prototype is an object instance.

### Benefits of prototype inheritance
We can extend native JS objects at runtime - allows to use polyfills to add new methods (not recommended) to existing objects.

### Difference between null and undefined
Undefined means a variable has been declared but has not yet been assigned. Null is an assignment value.
It can be assigned to a variable as a representation of no value.
